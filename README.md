CommanderGameData
Welcome to CommanderGameData! This repository marks the beginning of a project aimed at building a website for storing Commander decks and tracking game statistics associated with them.

Introduction
CommanderGameData is the midterm project for Web Programming II. The task was to create a dynamic application using Angular and MongoDB, focusing on a theme of personal interest. In this project, I aim to develop a platform that showcases my skills in web development while catering to my passion for tracking Commander games and decks.

Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project include:

Crafting dynamic Angular components to enhance user experience.
Designing and managing interactive templates for intuitive navigation.
Sharing data across components efficiently using Angular services.
Implementing smooth navigation through Angular routing mechanisms.
Creating reactive interfaces through data binding techniques.
Enhancing modularity and scalability through dependency injection.
Implementing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB.
Managing MongoDB collections and documents effectively.
Employing efficient data querying techniques to optimize performance.
Why CommanderGameData?
I found immense joy and interest in working on this project, which led me to extend it beyond the scope of a mere midterm assignment. CommanderGameData isn't just about fulfilling academic requirements; it's a passion project born out of my love for the Commander format and desire to create a useful tool for fellow players.

Stay tuned as CommanderGameData evolves to become a comprehensive platform for tracking Commander decks and games!
